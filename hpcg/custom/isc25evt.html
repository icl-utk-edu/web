<p>The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the ISC High Performance 2025
conference in the Conference Center Hamburg (CCH), Germany. The session
entitled <em>Highlights of the 65th TOP500 List including Awarding</em> took
place on Tuesday, June 10, 2025.</p>
<p>The HPCG results are now integrated alongside the TOP500 and Green500 lists.
The 23rd <a href="isc25.html">HPCG Performance List</a> of results contains the
complete collection of the submissions. Keep in mind that a few entries might
have not made it into the official TOP500 list due to a number of factors such
as a low HPL benchmark result or a missed deadline for the TOP500 submission.</p>
<p>This is the twenty third list produced by running the HPCG benchmark, which
was designed to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL)
benchmark used by the TOP500 and Green500 teams as their official metric for
ranking world's largest systems. The first HPCG list was announced a decade ago
at ISC 2014, and contained only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released
bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as the new
results became available. The current list contains over 130 entries, as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community: over 25% of TOP500 systems
submitted an HPCG score.</p>
<p>These 133 systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.  However,
the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different ordering of the
machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking. Both Fugaku and Frontier systems
were dethroned from the top of the list with a new submission from LLNL's El
Capitan. It achieved the new record score of over 17 Pflop/s thus surpassing 16
and 14 Pflop/s of achieved performance by Fugaku and Frontier,
respectively.</p>
<p>
Summary highlights from the 23rd HPCG list include:
<ul>
<li>The new #1 system is El Capitan installed at LLNL by DOE/SC at 17.4 Pflop/s also leading the TOP500 list.</li>
<li>The new #2 system is Fugaku installed at Riken at 16 Pflop/s which held the #1 position since ISC 2020.</li>
<li>The new #3 system is Frontier installed at ORNL at 14 Pflop/s which held the #2 position since SC22.</li>
</ul>
