<div class="ItemTitle">HPCG Performance List was announced at a BOF at SC 2017</div>
<div class="ItemContent"><p>First, please note that the HPCG results are now integrated into
the TOP500 list. To see the complete list of machines that did not make
the TOP500, please use
<a href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=293.html">the list</a>
on the HPCG site.</p>
<p>The bi-annual High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG)
Benchmark list was announced on November 13, 2017 at SC17.
This is the eighth list produced for the benchmark designed
to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark
used as the official metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first
HPCG list was announced at ISC 2014 over three years ago, containing
only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released bi-annually and
the number of entries has steadily increased as the new results
became available. The current list contains 115 entries as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community.</p>
<p>It is now customary that the new list contains entries from many
of the TOP500's highest ranked, mainly top-50 systems. The current
list is no exception. The HPCG ranking continues to provide
a significantly different ordering of the machines when compared
with the TOP500 ranking. It is worth noting that the ranking of the
Sunway TaihuLight remains at the top of the TOP500 list for the fourth
time, but has dropped from third (ISC 2016) to fourth (SC16), then and
back to third (ISC 2017) to finally be down to position 5 on the
current HPCG list. For the HPL benchmark, the Sunway system was about
3 times faster than the second place system (Tianhe-2). For the HPCG
score, it is about 20% slower than the fastest HPCG machine.</p>
<p>Summary highlights from the 8th HPCG list include:
<ul>
<li>Top 10 machines experienced a serious rearrangement compared to the previous list.</li>
<li>United States returns to the top-3 club with Trinity.</li>
<li>Trinity gets a hardware upgrade and improves its HPCG score from 0.18 Pflop/s to 0.55 Pflop/s.</li>
<li>Piz Daint passes TaihuLight with an improved result to secure fourth place.</li>
<li>TSUBAME 3.0 submits a new result with 4x improvement in performance.</li>
<li>Mare Nostrum 4 shows large scale HPCG performance on the Intel Skylake cores.</li>
<li>First NVIDIA Volta results come from the recently released DGX-1V system.</li>
<li>International Space Station computer provided by HPE submits HPCG result.</li>
</ul>
