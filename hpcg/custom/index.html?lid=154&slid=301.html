<div class="ItemTitle">HPCG Performance List to be announced at a SC 2019</div>
<p>
The HPCG results continue to be integrated into the TOP500 list. As before, the 12th edition
of the HPCG list of results contains all submissions submitted to the HPCG site, some of which
might have not made the TOP500 list.
</p>

<p>
The 12th edition of the bi-annual High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=302.html">list</a>
will be announced on November 21, 2019 at the SC19 conference in Denver, CO, USA.
The session entitled <a
href="https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess303">HPCG Benchmark Update</a>
will take place on Thursday, November 21, 2019 in Rooms 704-706 at 12:15pm in the Colorado
Convention Center.
</p>

<p>
This is the twelfth list produced for the benchmark that was designed to complement the
traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the official
metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC
2014 over five years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list
was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as
the new results became available. The current list contains over 150 entries as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
It is now customary that the new list contains entries from many of the
TOP500's highest ranked systems, mainly the top-50. The current list is no
exception. However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared with the TOP500 ranking.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 10th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>Decommissioning of K computer changed the dynamic of top 5 systems.</li>
    <li>Top 3 systems come from US now and were commissioned by DOE.</li>
    <li>France now has a system in top 10.</li>
    <li>Additional ARM systems are now part of the list.</li>
    <li>A new type of system from NEC was reported in this edition and it's based SX-Aurora. Two different configurations were reported to show the scaling capability.</li>
    <li>The total number of systems is 160 despite retirement of some of the machines from the previous list.</li>
</ul>
