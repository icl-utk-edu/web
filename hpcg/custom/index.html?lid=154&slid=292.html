<div class="ItemContent"><p>
HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list.
</p>

<p>
The High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark list was
announced on June 21, 2017 at ISC 2017.  This is the seventh list
produced for the benchmark designed to complement the traditional
High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the official metric
for ranking the TOP500 systems.  The first HPCG list was announced at
ISC 2014 three years ago, containing only 15 entries.  Since then HPCG
list was released twice a year, the number of entries has steadily
increased.  The current list contains 110 entries as HPCG continues
to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
The 7th list contains entries from many of the TOP500's highest
ranked, mainly top 50 systems, but continues to provide
a significantly different ordering. Of particular note is the ranking
of the Sunway TaihuLight, which remains at the top of the HPL list for
the third time, but has dropped from third (ISC 2016) to fourth (SC16)
and back to third on the current HPCG list.  For HPL, the Sunway system was
about 3 times faster than the second place system (Tianhe-2).
For HPCG, it is about 2 times slower than the fastest machine.

<p>
The highlights from the 7th HPCG list:
<ul>
<li>HPCG list of supercomputing sites now features 110 entries, most majority of them from the very top of the TOP500 list.</li>
<li>The Riken/Fujitsu K Computer is in first place, a spot it claimed at SC16.</li>
<li>The upgraded Piz Daint system from CSCS is fourth on the list.</li>
<li>The Sunway TaihuLight system is ranked 3rd for HPCG, despite being ranked 1st for TOP500.</li>
<li>The HPCG list has been integrated into the TOP500 list for the first time.</li>
<li>The relative difference of the third and fourth system is less than 1% and they were jointly recognized at the BOF.</li>
</ul>
