<p>
The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the ISC 2022 hybrid event at
Hamburg Conference Center in Hamburg, Germany. The session entitled
<em>Highlights of the 59th TOP500 List including Awards</em> took place on Monday, May 30, 2022.
</p>

<p>
Some of the HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list. The 17th <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=313.html">HPCG
Performance List</a> of results contains the complete collection of
submissions, some of which might have not made the TOP500 list due to a number
of factors such as a low HPL benchmark result or missing the TOP500 submission
deadline.
</p>

<p>
This is the seventeenth list produced by running the HPCG benchmark designed to
complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark that is
used as the official metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was
announced at ISC 2014 over seven years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since
then, HPCG list was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily
increased as the new results became available. The current list contains over
200 entries, as HPCG continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
Over 100 systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking.  Fugaku system
from Japan continues leading the list with 16 Pflop/s of achieved performance
or about as much as the sum of the 15 systems that follow.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 17th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>The Fugaku housed at RIKEN continues as #1 system.</li>
    <li>No results submitted from Frontier: #1 system of TOP500.</li>
    <li>LUMI system from Europe displaced Summit as the new #3 system.</li>
    <li>Over 20% of TOP500 machines now report HPCG results.</li>
</ul>
