The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the SC22 event in
Dallas Convention Center in Dallas, Texas, USA. The session entitled
<em>Highlights of the 60th TOP500 List including Awarding</em> took place on Tuesday, November 15, 2022.
</p>
<p>
Majority of the HPCG results are now integrated in the TOP500 list. The 18th <a
href="sc22.html">HPCG Performance List</a> of results contains the complete
collection of the submissions, some of which might have not made it into
the official TOP500 list due to a number of factors such as a low HPL benchmark
result or a missed deadline for the TOP500 submission.
</p>
<p>
This is the eighteenth list produced by running the HPCG benchmark, which was
designed to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark
used by the TOP500 team as their official metric for ranking world's largest
systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC 2014 over eight years ago, and
contained only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released bi-annually and
the number of entries has steadily increased as the new results became
available. The current list contains over 100 entries, as HPCG continues to
gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>
<p>
These 100+ systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking.  Fugaku system
from Japan continues leading the list with 16 Pflop/s of achieved performance.
This result is slightly higher then ORNL's Frontier score of 14 Pflop/s.
This is the prominent reversal of ranking between the TOP500 and HPCG lists.
</p>
<p>
Summary highlights from the 18th HPCG list include:
<ul>
<li>The Fugaku housed at RIKEN continues as #1 system.</li>
<li>The result submitted from Frontier features it as #1 system of TOP500 and #2 on HPCG list.</li>
<li>New result from the Italian system called Leonardo is very close to that of ORNL's Summit machine.</li>
</ul>
