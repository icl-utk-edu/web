<div class="ItemTitle">HPCG Performance List was announced at a BOF at SC16</div>
<div class="ItemContent"><p>
The 6th HPCG Performance List was presented at SC16 on Tuesday,
November 15 at 5:15 pm, during the TOP500 BOF and on Wednesday,
November 16 at 5:15 pm (room 355-E) during the HPCG BOF,
where additional details from vendors was presented.
</p>
<p>
The High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark list was
announced at SC16.  This is the sixth list produced for a benchmark
designed to complement the traditional
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl">High Performance LINPACK</a>
(HPL) benchmark used as the official metric for ranking the
<a href="http://www.top500.org/">TOP500</a>
systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC 2014 two and a half
years ago, containing only 15 entries, the SC15 list had 60 and
ISCâ€™16 had 80.  The current list contains more than 100 entries
as HPCG continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>
<p>
The SC16 list contains entries for more than half of the top 50
systems from TOP500, but exhibits a significant shuffling of the HPL
rankings, indicating that HPCG features are exposing different and
complementary system characteristics.
</p>
<p>
The announcement was made during a session entitled
<a href="http://sc16.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof106&sess=sess324">HPCG Benchmark Update</a>
took place on Wednesday, November 16, 2016 in room 355-E
in Salt Lake Palace Convention Center.
</p>
<p>
The full list of <a href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=289.html">November 2016 results</a>
is now available. Final set of slides presented at the session
is also available.
</p>
<p>
Highlights from the 6th HPCG Performance List:
<ul>
<li>HPCG list of supercomputing sites now features over 100 entries,
most of them from the very top of the TOP500 list.</li>
<li>More effective optimization of HPCG to K Computer put it at the top
of the list.</li>
<li>Strong showing from Japan with number 1 and number 3 entries.</li>
<li>HPCG shows significant difference in rankings compared to HPL,
especially for top systems.</li>
<li>Vendor optimizations illustrate adaptability of HPCG and they
inform similar adaptations for important applications.</li>
</ul>
