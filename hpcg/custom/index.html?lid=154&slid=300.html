<div class="ItemTitle">HPCG Performance List was announced at ISC 2019</div>
<p>
The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the ISC 2019 conference in
Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The session entitled TOP500, Green500 &amp; HPCG
Awards took place on Monday, June 17, 2019 in Panorama Room at 11:00 in Messe
Frankfurt.
</p>

<p>
The HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list. The main <a
    href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=299.html">HPCG
list</a> of results contains the complete list of submissions some of which
might have not made the TOP500 list.
</p>

<p>
The bi-annual High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=299.html">list</a>
was announced on June 17, 2019 at the ISC 2019
conference in Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The session entitled <a
href="https://2019.isc-program.com/presentation/?id=int_spe103&sess=sess169">TOP500,
Green500 &amp; HPCG Awards</a> took place on Monday, June 17, 2019 in Panorama Room
at 11:00 in Messe Frankfurt.
</p>

<p>
This is the eleventh list produced for the benchmark designed to complement the
traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the official
metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC
2014 over five years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list
was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as
the new results became available. The current list contains over 150 entries as
HPCG continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
It is now customary that the new list contains entries from many of the
TOP500's highest ranked, mainly top-50 systems. The current list is no
exception. However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared with the TOP500 ranking.
A major change in TOP500 ranking is now reflected in the HPCG results.
Summit and Sierra supercomputers continue to lead the HPCG list with their
score breaking the 1 Pflop/s barrier and almost approaching 3 Pflop/s for the
number 1 system.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 11th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>No changes in the ranking of the first 15 systems</li>
    <li>The largest ARM system on the list, ASTRA, now has a new HPCG result that is 50% higher than 6 months ago.</li>
    <li>ASTRA is not the only one ARM system on the list any more.</li>
</ul>
