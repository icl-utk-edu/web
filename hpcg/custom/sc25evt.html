<p>The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the SC25
conference in the America’s Center Convention Complex, St. Louis, MO, USA.
The session entitled <em>TOP500 Supercomputers</em> highlighting the 66th
TOP500 list took place on Tuesday, November 19, 2025.</p>
<p>The HPCG results are now integrated alongside the TOP500 and Green500 lists.
The 24th <a href="sc25.html">HPCG Performance List</a> of results contains the
complete collection of the submissions. Keep in mind that a few entries might
have not made it into the official TOP500 list due to a number of factors such
as a low HPL benchmark result or a missed deadline for the TOP500 submission.</p>
<p>This is the twenty fourth list produced by running the HPCG benchmark, which
was designed to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL)
benchmark used by the TOP500 and Green500 teams as their official metric for
ranking world's largest systems. The first HPCG list was announced over a
decade ago
at ISC 2014, and contained only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released
bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as the new
results became available. The current list contains nearly 130 entries, as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community: over 25% of TOP500 systems
submitted an HPCG score.</p>
<p>These 129 systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.  However,
the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different ordering of the
machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking. Both Fugaku and Frontier systems
follow LLNL's El Capitan, which continues dominating the list. The top score of
over 17 Pflop/s surpasses 16 and 14 Pflop/s of performance achieved by Fugaku
and Frontier, respectively.</p>
<p>
Summary highlights from the 24th HPCG list include:
<ul>
<li>The new #1 system is El Capitan installed at LLNL by DOE/SC at 17.4 Pflop/s also leading the TOP500 list.</li>
<li>The new #2 system is Fugaku installed at Riken at 16 Pflop/s which held the #1 position since ISC 2020.</li>
<li>The new #3 system is Frontier installed at ORNL at 14 Pflop/s which held the #2 position since SC22.</li>
<li>The new JUPITER Booster system, the first exascale computer in Europe,  has not submitted an HPCG result yet.</li>
</ul>
