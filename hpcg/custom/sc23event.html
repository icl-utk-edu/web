The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the SC23 event in
Colorado Convention Center in Denver, Colorado, USA. The session entitled
<em>Highlights of the 60th TOP500 List</em> took place on Tuesday, November
14, 2023.
</p>
<p>
The majority of the HPCG results are now integrated in the TOP500 list. The
20th <a href="sc23.html">HPCG Performance List</a> of results contains the
complete collection of the submissions, some of which might have not made it
into the official TOP500 list due to a number of factors such as a low HPL
benchmark result or a missed deadline for the TOP500 submission.
</p>
<p>
This is the twentiethteenth list produced by running the HPCG benchmark, which
was designed to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL)
benchmark used by the TOP500 team as their official metric for ranking world's
largest systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC 2014 over eight
years ago, and contained only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released
bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as the new
results became available. The current list contains over 110 entries, as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>
<p>
These 110+ systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking. Both Fugaku and
Frontier systems continue to open the list with 16 and 14 Pflop/s of achieved
performance, respectively.
</p>
<p>
Summary highlights from the 20th HPCG list include:
<ul>
<li>New result from the upgraded LUMI increased its performance to about
3-times slower than the #1 and #2 systems from being 5-times slower in
previous lists.</li>
<li>Perlmutter was upgraded but did not submit a new result thus it's fraction of peak performance dropped from 2% to 1.7%.</li>
<li>To make it into the exclusive top-10 ranking,  requires at least 1 Pflop/s. </li>
</ul>
