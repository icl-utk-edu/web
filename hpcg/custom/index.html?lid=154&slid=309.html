<p>
The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the ISC 2021 virtual event.  The
session entitled HPCG Benchmark Update took place on Wednesday, June
30, 2021.
</p>

<p>
Some of the HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list. The main <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=310.html">HPCG
list</a> of results contains the complete list of submissions some of which
might have not made the TOP500 list due to a number of factors like low HPL
benchmark result or missing the submission deadline.
</p>

<p>
The bi-annual High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=310.html">list</a>
was announced on June 30, 2020 at the ISC 2020 conference.
</p>

<p>
This is the fifteenth list produced for the benchmark designed to complement the
traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the official
metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC
2014 over six years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list
was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as
the new results became available. The current list contains nearly 200 entries as
HPCG continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
It is now customary that the new list contains entries from many of the
TOP500's highest ranked, mainly top-50 systems &mdash; in total, there are now
92 systems shared between the lists.  The current list is no exception.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking.
A major change in TOP500 ranking is now reflected in the HPCG results.
Fugaku system from Japan leads the list with over 13 Pflop/s of achieved performance.
Summit is still in second position but Sierra supercomputer was now replaced with the new entry: Perlmutter.
More than half of top-10 entries now break the 1 Pflop/s barrier.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 15th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>The Fugaku housed at RIKEN continues as #1 system.</li>
    <li>Entering the top-10 part of the list now requires performance exceeding three-quarters of a Peta-flop.</li>
</ul>
