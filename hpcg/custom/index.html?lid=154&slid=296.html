<p>
The HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list. The main <a
    href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=295.html">HPCG
list</a> of results contains the complete list of submissions some of which
might have not made the TOP500 list.
</p>

<p>
The bi-annual High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark <a
href="index.html%3Flid=155&amp;slid=295.html">list</a>
was announced on June 25, 2018 at the ISC 2018
conference in Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The session entitled <a
href="https://2018.isc-program.com/?page_id=10&id=inv_sp_nm106&sess=sess107">TOP500,
Green500 <&amp;> HPCG Awards</a> took place on Monday, June 25, 2018 in Panorama Room
at 10:45 in Messe Frankfurt.
</p>

<p>
This is the ninth list produced for the benchmark designed to complement the
traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the official
metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC
2014 over four years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list
was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as
the new results became available. The current list contains 130 entries as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
It is now customary that the new list contains entries from many of the
TOP500's highest ranked, mainly top-50 systems. The current list is no
exception. However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared with the TOP500 ranking.
A major change in TOP500 ranking is now reflected in the HPCG results.
Summit and Sierra supercomputers lead the HPCG list with their score breaking
the 1 Pflop/s barrier and almost approaching 3 Pflop/s for the number 1 system.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 9th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>Top 1 machine achieve nearly 3 Pflop/s with 2.9 Pflop/s score</li>
    <li>Two machines at the top scored over 1 Pflop/s.</li>
    <li>For the first time, no Chinese machines are present in the top 5 replaced by three US, one Japanese, and one Swiss machine.</li>
</ul>
