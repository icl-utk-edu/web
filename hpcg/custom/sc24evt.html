The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the SC24 event in The Georgia
World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The session entitled
<em>Highlights of the 64th TOP500 List</em> took place on Tuesday, November
19, 2024.
</p>
<p>
The majority of the HPCG results are now integrated in the TOP500 list. The
22nd <a href="sc24.html">HPCG Performance List</a> of results contains the
complete collection of the submissions, some of which might have not made it
into the official TOP500 list due to a number of factors such as a low HPL
benchmark result or a missed deadline for the TOP500 submission.
</p>
<p>
This is the twenty second list produced by running the HPCG benchmark, which
was designed to complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL)
benchmark used by the TOP500 team as their official metric for ranking world's
largest systems. The first HPCG list was announced at ISC 2014 over ten
years ago, and contained only 15 entries. Since then, HPCG list was released
bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily increased as the new
results became available. The current list contains over 120 entries, as HPCG
continues to gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>
<p>
These 120+ systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking. Both Fugaku and
Frontier systems continue to open the list with 16 and 14 Pflop/s of achieved
performance, respectively. The newer machines from the very top of TOP500 did
not yet submit HPCG results and this includes both Aurora and El Capitan.
