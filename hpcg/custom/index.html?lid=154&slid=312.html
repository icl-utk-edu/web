<p>
The new HPCG Performance List was announced at the SC21 hybrid event at
America's Center in Saint Louis, MO and onlie. The session entitled <em>TOP500, Green500 &amp; HPCG
    Awards</em> took place on Monday, November 22, 2021.
</p>

<p>
Some of the HPCG results are now integrated into the TOP500 list. The 16th <a
href="index.html%3Flid=154&amp;slid=312.html">HPCG
Performance List</a> of results contains the complete collection of
submissions, some of which might have not made the TOP500 list due to a number
of factors such as a low HPL benchmark result or missing the TOP500 submission
deadline.
</p>

<p>
This is the sixteenth list produced for the HPCG benchmark designed to
complement the traditional High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark used as the
official metric for ranking the TOP500 systems. The first HPCG list was
announced at ISC 2014 over six years ago, containing only 15 entries. Since
then, HPCG list was released bi-annually and the number of entries has steadily
increased as the new results became available. The current list contains over
220 entries, about 5% increase since the last release, as HPCG continues to
gain traction in the HPC community.
</p>

<p>
About 100 systems from the HPCG list are also ranked by TOP500.
However, the HPCG ranking continues to provide a significantly different
ordering of the machines when compared to the TOP500 ranking.
Fugaku system from Japan leads the list with 16 Pflop/s of achieved performance
or about as much as the sum of the 15 systems that follow.
</p>

<p>
Summary highlights from the 16th HPCG list include:
<ul>
    <li>The Fugaku housed at RIKEN continues as #1 system.</li>
    <li>Fraction of peak dipped for Perlumtter because the size of the system increased but HPCG result was not updated</li>
</ul>
