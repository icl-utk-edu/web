Reference Implementation
------------------------

We have provided a [reference implementation](https://bitbucket.org/icl/hpl-ai/)
on Bitbucket in order to show how the benchmark could be implemented.  Please
note that a variety of optimizations should be applied to the code to achieve a
higher performance rate.

Vendor Implementations
----------------------

NVIDIA released a [container
image](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/hpc-benchmarks)
with a few HPC benchmarks including HPL-AI implementation (requires NVIDIA
Account to download).
